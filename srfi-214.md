## Abstract

A _flexvector_, also known as a dynamic array or an arraylist, is a mutable vector-like data structure with an adjustable size. Flexvectors allow O(1) random access, O(1) insertion/removal at the end, and O(n) insertion/removal elsewhere. This SRFI defines a suite of operations on flexvectors, modeled after [SRFI 133][srfi-133]'s vector operations.

## Issues

The test suite does not yet fully cover the specification. There are several additional flexvector operations that would be useful (`flexvector-append!`, `flexvector-append-map`) that are not in this draft but may be included in a future draft.

## Rationale

Unlike the default vector datatype of many other languages, Scheme vectors have a fixed length. This makes vectors unusable as mutable stacks or queues, and is the reason that [SRFI 133][srfi-133] lacks common collection operations like `filter`.

In fact, no Scheme standard defines a mutable datatype that is suitable for this very common purpose, analogous to a Java `ArrayList` or to the default list data structure in JavaScript or Python. [SRFI 117][srfi-117] defines the commonly-used "tconc" mutable queue, but it is a linked list. And [SRFI 134][srfi-134] defines a deque datatype, but that datatype is immutable. Neither data structure has the (often useful) properties of being a mutable, contiguous, random-access sequence.

This SRFI does not define a comparator or any sorting procedures, in order to ensure that it has no dependencies. These may be defined in future SRFIs.

### Terminology

What this SRFI calls a _flexvector_ is better known as a [_dynamic array_][dynamic-array]. This data structure has a wide variety of names in different languages:

- JavaScript and Ruby call it an _array_
- Python calls it a _list_
- Java calls it an `ArrayList` (and, before that, it was called a `Vector`)

Scheme literature already uses the terms _list_ (for `cons` lists), _vector_ (for fixed-length vectors), and _array_ (for fixed-length numeric arrays), so a new term is needed. Because _array_ in Scheme refers to a numeric array, the term _dynamic array_ is not ideal. _Dynamic vector_ is a possibility, but `dynamic-vector` would be an unwieldy prefix due to its length. The newly-minted term _flexvector_ communicates this data structure's flexible size and its relationship to Scheme vectors, while being only as long as an existing Scheme data type name (`bytevector`).

### Procedure inclusion and naming

This SRFI is primarily modeled on [SRFI 133][srfi-133]. It includes flexvector equivalents of all SRFI 133 procedures, most with the same names and argument order. There are two notable exceptions:

1. `flexvector-unfold` mimics the API of [SRFI 1][srfi-1]'s `unfold`, not SRFI 133's `vector-unfold`. `vector-unfold` is limited by the necessity of a fixed vector length, while `flexvector-unfold` may generate a flexvector of any length, and so the `unfold` API is more useful.
2. The flexvector equivalent of `vector=` is `flexvector=?`. It is conventional for Scheme equality predicates to end in `=?` (e.g., `symbol=?`, `string=?`), and most data structure SRFIs follow this convention (see [SRFI 113][srfi-113], [125][srfi-125], [146][srfi-146]). This SRFI follows established convention, even when it does not match SRFI 133's procedure names.

Additionally, this SRFI includes deque-like operations that reference, add to, and remove from both ends of a flexvector. The naming convention for these operations is taken from [SRFI 134][srfi-134], which uses the terms _front_ and _back_. _Front_ refers to the start of the flexvector (index 0), while _back_ refers to the end (index `(- (flexvector-length x) 1)`).

## Specification

In this section, the following notation is used to specify parameters and examples:

- Parameters named `fv` are always flexvectors.

- `x ...` indicates that zero or more of the parameter `x` are allowed.

- `[x]` indicates that the parameter `x` is optional. Multiple optional parameters may be written `[x [y]]`.

- `;=>` separates an example expression from its expected result.

- `Î»` is a shorthand alias for `lambda`.

Additionally, examples include literal flexvector values written using [SRFI 10][srfi-10] notation: `#,(flexvector a b c)` is a flexvector of length 3 containg the symbol values `a`, `b`, and `c`. **This notation is only used for example purposes.** This SRFI does not depend on SRFI 10, and it does not define the `#,(flexvector x ...)` syntax for actual use.

### Constructors

#### `make-flexvector`

`(make-flexvector size [fill])`

Creates and returns a flexvector of size `size`. If `fill` is specified, all of the elements of the vector are initialized to `fill`. Otherwise, their contents are indeterminate.

```scheme
(make-flexvector 5 3) ;=> #,(flexvector 3 3 3 3 3)
```

#### `flexvector`

`(flexvector x ...)`

Creates and returns a flexvector whose elements are `x ...`.

```scheme
(flexvector 0 1 2 3 4) ;=> #,(flexvector 0 1 2 3 4)
```

#### `flexvector-unfold`, `flexvector-unfold-right`

`(flexvector-unfold p f g initial-seed ...)`

The fundamental flexvector constructor. `flexvector-unfold` is modeled on SRFI 1 `unfold` instead of SRFI 133 `vector-unfold`, because flexvectors are not limited to a predetermined length.

For each step, `flexvector-unfold` evaluates `p` on the seed value(s) to determine whether it should stop unfolding. If `p` returns `#f`, it then evaluates `f` on the seed value(s) to produce the next element, then evaluates `g` on the seed value(s) to produce the seed value(s) for the next step. The recursion can be described with this algorithm:

```scheme
(let recur ((seeds initial-seed) (fv (flexvector)))
  (if (apply p seeds) fv
      (let-values ((next-seeds (apply g seeds)))
        (recur next-seeds (flexvector-add-back! fv (apply f seeds))))))
```

This is guaranteed to build a flexvector in O(n), because `flexvector-add-back!` is O(1). `flexvector-unfold-right` is a variant that constructs a flexvector right-to-left, and uses `flexvector-add-front!` instead, which may be slower than O(n).

#### `flexvector-copy`, `flexvector-reverse-copy`

`(flexvector-copy fv [start [end]])`

Allocates a new flexvector whose length is `(- end start)` and fills it with elements from `fv`, taking elements from `fv` starting at index `start` and stopping at index `end`. `start` defaults to `0` and `end` defaults to the value of `(flexvector-length fv)`.

```scheme
(flexvector-copy (flexvector 'a 'b 'c)) ;=> #,(flexvector a b c)
(flexvector-copy (flexvector 'a 'b 'c) 1) ;=> #,(flexvector b c)
(flexvector-copy (flexvector 'a 'b 'c) 1 2) ;=> #,(flexvector b)
```

`flexvector-reverse-copy` is the same, but copies the elements in reverse order from `fv`.

```scheme
(flexvector-reverse-copy (flexvector 'a 'b 'c 'd) 1 4)
;=> #,(flexvector d c b)
```

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `flexvector-append`

`(flexvector-append fv ...)`

Returns a newly allocated flexvector that contains all elements in order from the subsequent locations in `fv ...`.

```scheme
(flexvector-append (flexvector 'x) (flexvector 'y))
;=> #,(flexvector x y)

(flexvector-append (flexvector 'a) (flexvector 'b 'c 'd))
;=> #,(flexvector a b c d)

(flexvector-append (flexvector 'a (flexvector 'b))
                   (flexvector (flexvector 'c)))
;=> #,(flexvector a #,(flexvector b) #,(flexvector c))
```

#### `flexvector-concatenate`

`(flexvector-concatenate list-of-flexvectors)`

Equivalent to `(apply flexvector-append list-of-flexvectors)`, but may be implemented more efficiently.

```scheme
(flexvector-concatenate (list (flexvector 'a 'b) (flexvector 'c 'd)))
;=> #,(flexvector a b c d)
```

#### `flexvector-append-subvectors`

`(flexvector-append-subvectors [fv start end] ...)`

Returns a vector that contains every element of each `fv` from `start` to `end` in the specified order. This procedure is a generalization of `flexvector-append`.

```scheme
(flexvector-append-subvectors (flexvector 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e) 0 2
                              (flexvector 'f 'g 'h 'i 'j) 2 4)
;=> #,(flexvector a b h i)
```

### Predicates

#### `flexvector?`

`(flexvector? x)`

Disjoint type predicate for flexvectors: this returns `#t` if `x` is a flexvector, and `#f` otherwise.

```scheme
(flexvector? (flexvector 1 2 3)) ;=> #t
(flexvector? (vector 1 2 3)) ;=> #f
```

#### `flexvector-empty?`

`(flexvector-empty? fv)`

Returns `#t` if `fv` is empty (i.e., its length is `0`), and `#f` if not.

```scheme
(flexvector-empty? (flexvector)) ;=> #t
(flexvector-empty? (flexvector 'a)) ;=> #f
(flexvector-empty? (flexvector (flexvector))) ;=> #f
```

#### `flexvector=?`

`(flexvector=? elt=? fv ...)`

Flexvector structural equality predicate, generalized across user-specified element equality predicates. Flexvectors `a` and `b` are considered equal by `flexvector=?` iff their lengths are the same and, for each index `i` less than `(flexvector-length a)`, `(elt=? (flexvector-ref a i) (flexvector-ref b i))` is true. `elt=?` is always applied to two arguments.

```scheme
(flexvector=? eq? (flexvector 'a 'b) (flexvector 'a 'b)) ;=> #t
(flexvector=? eq? (flexvector 'a 'b) (flexvector 'b 'a)) ;=> #f
(flexvector=? = (flexvector 1 2 3 4 5) (flexvector 1 2 3 4)) ;=> #f
(flexvector=? = (flexvector 1 2 3 4) (flexvector 1 2 3 4)) ;=> #t
```

`flexvector=?` returns `#t` if it is passed zero or one `fv` arguments. The execution order of comparisons is intentionally left unspecified.

```scheme
(flexvector=? eq?) ;=> #t
(flexvector=? eq? (flexvector 'a)) ;=> #t
```

### Selectors

#### `flexvector-ref`

`(flexvector-ref fv i)`

Flexvector element dereferencing: returns the value at location `i` in `fv`. Indexing is zero-based. It is an error if `i` is outside the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`).

```scheme
(flexvector-ref (flexvector 'a 'b 'c 'd) 2) ;=> c
```

#### `flexvector-front`

`(flexvector-front fv)`

Returns the first element in `fv`. It is an error if `fv` is empty. Alias for `(flexvector-ref fv 0)`.

```scheme
(flexvector-front (flexvector 'a 'b 'c 'd)) ;=> a
```

#### `flexvector-back`

`(flexvector-back fv)`

Returns the last element in `fv`. It is an error if `fv` is empty. Alias for `(flexvector-ref fv (- (flexvector-length fv) 1))`.

```scheme
(flexvector-back (flexvector 'a 'b 'c 'd)) ;=> d
```

#### `flexvector-length`

`(flexvector-length fv)`

Returns the length of `fv`, which is the number of elements contained in `fv`.

    (flexvector-length (flexvector 'a 'b 'c)) ;=> 3

### Mutators

#### `flexvector-add!`

`(flexvector-add! fv i x ...)`

Inserts the elements `x ...` into `fv` at the location `i`, preserving their order and shifting all elements after `i` backward to make room. This increases the length of `fv` by the number of elements inserted.

It is an error if `i` is outside the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`].

`flexvector-add!` returns `fv` after mutating it.

```scheme
(flexvector-add! (flexvector 'a 'b) 1 'c) ;=> #,(flexvector a c b)
(flexvector-add! (flexvector 'a 'b) 2 'c 'd 'e) ;=> #,(flexvector a b c d e)
```

#### `flexvector-add-front!`, `flexvector-add-back!`

`(flexvector-add-front! fv x ...)`

Inserts the elements `x ...` into the front or back of `fv`, preserving their order. This increases the length of `fv` by the number of elements inserted. `flexvector-add-back!` of one element is guaranteed to execute in O(1).

These procedures return `fv` after mutating it.

```scheme
(flexvector-add-front! (flexvector 'a 'b) 'c) ;=> #,(flexvector c a b)
(flexvector-add-front! (flexvector 'a 'b) 'c 'd) ;=> #,(flexvector c d a b)

(flexvector-add-back! (flexvector 'a 'b) 'c) ;=> #,(flexvector a b c)
(flexvector-add-back! (flexvector 'a 'b) 'c 'd) ;=> #,(flexvector a b c d)
```

#### `flexvector-add-all!`

`(flexvector-add-all! fv i xs)`

Inserts the elements of the list `xs` into `fv` at location `i`. Equivalent to `(apply flexvector-add! fv i xs)`. Returns `fv` after mutating it.

```scheme
(flexvector-add-all! (flexvector 'a 'b) 2 '(c d e)) ;=> #,(flexvector a b c d e)
```

#### `flexvector-remove!`

`(flexvector-remove! fv i)`

Removes and returns the element at `i` in `fv`, then shifts all subsequent elements forward, reducing the length of `fv` by 1.

It is an error if `i` is outside the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`).

#### `flexvector-remove-front!`, `flexvector-remove-back!`

`(flexvector-remove-front! fv)`

Removes and returns the first element from `fv`, then shifts all other elements forward. `flexvector-remove-back!` instead removes the last element, without moving any other elements, and is guaranteed to execute in O(1).

It is an error if `fv` is empty.

#### `flexvector-remove-range!`

`(flexvector-remove-range! fv start [end])`

Removes all elements from `fv` between `start` and `end`, shifting all elements after `end` forward by `(- end start)`. If `end` is not present, it defaults to `(flexvector-length fv)`.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

`flexvector-remove-range!` returns `fv` after mutating it.

#### `flexvector-clear!`

`(flexvector-clear! fv)`

Removes all items from `fv`, setting its length to 0. Returns `fv` after mutating it.

#### `flexvector-set!`

`(flexvector-set! fv i x)`

Assigns the value of `x` to the location `i` in `fv`. It is an error if `i` is outside the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`]. If `i` is equal to `(flexvector-length fv)`, `x` is appended after the last element in `fv`; this is equivalent to `flexvector-add-back!`.

Returns the previous value at location `i` in `fv`, or an unspecified value if `i` is equal to `(flexvector-length fv)`.

#### `flexvector-swap!`

`(flexvector-swap! fv i j)`

Swaps or exchanges the values of the locations in `fv` at indexes `i` and `j`. It is an error if either `i` or `j` is outside the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). Returns `fv` after mutating it.

#### `flexvector-fill!`

`(flexvector-fill! fv fill [start [end]])`

Assigns the value of every location in `fv` between `start`, which defaults to 0 and `end`, which defaults to the length of `fv`, to `fill`. Returns `fv` after mutating it.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`]. It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `flexvector-reverse!`

`(flexvector-reverse! fv)`

Destructively reverses `fv` in-place. Returns `fv` after mutating it.

#### `flexvector-copy!`, `flexvector-reverse-copy!`

`(flexvector-copy! to at from [start [end]])`

Copies the elements of flexvector `from` between `start` and `end` to flexvector `to`, starting at `at`. The order in which elements are copied is unspecified, except that if the source and destination overlap, copying takes place as if the source is first copied into a temporary vector and then into the destination. This can be achieved without allocating storage by making sure to copy in the correct direction in such circumstances.

`flexvector-reverse-copy!` is the same, but copies elements in reverse order.

`start` and `end` default to 0 and `(flexvector-length from)` if not present. Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length from)`]. It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

Unlike `vector-copy!`, `flexvector-copy!` may copy elements past the end of `to`, which will increase the length of `to`.

Both procedures return `to` after mutating it.

#### `flexvector-unfold!`, `flexvector-unfold-right!`

`(flexvector-unfold! f fv start end initial-seed ...)`

Like `flexvector-unfold`, but the elements are copied into the flexvector `fv` starting at element `start` rather than into a newly allocated flexvector. Terminates when `(- end start)` elements have been generated.

`flexvector-unfold-right!` is the same, but copies elements in reverse order, starting at the index preceding `end`.

It is an error if `start` is less than 0 or `end` is less than `start`. Unlike `vector-unfold!`, `flexvector-unfold!` allows `end` to be greater than the length of `fv`; this will grow the length of `fv` to `end`.

Both procedures return `fv` after mutating it.

### Iteration

#### `flexvector-fold`, `flexvector-fold-right`

`(flexvector-fold kons knil fv1 fv2 ...)`

The fundamental flexvector iterator. `kons` is iterated over each value in all of the vectors, stopping at the end of the shortest; `kons` is applied as `(kons state (flexvector-ref fv1 i) (flexvector-ref fv2 i) ...)` where `state` is the current state valueâthe current state value begins with `knil`, and becomes whatever `kons` returned on the previous iterationâand `i` is the current index.

The iteration of `flexvector-fold` is strictly left-to-right. The iteration of `flexvector-fold-right` is strictly right-to-left.

```scheme
(flexvector-fold (Î» (len str) (max (string-length str) len))
                 0
                 (flexvector "baz" "qux" "quux"))
;=> 4

(flexvector-fold-right (Î» (tail elt) (cons elt tail))
                       '()
                       (flexvector 1 2 3))
;=> (1 2 3)

(flexvector-fold (Î» (counter n)
                   (if (even? n) (+ counter 1) counter))
                 0
                 (flexvector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7))
;=> 3
```

#### `flexvector-map`, `flexvector-map/index`

`(flexvector-map f fv1 fv2 ...)`

Constructs a new flexvector of the shortest size of the flexvector arguments. Each element at index `i` of the new flexvector is mapped from the old flexvectors by `(f (flexvector-ref fv1 i) (flexvector-ref fv2 i) ...)`. The dynamic order of application of `f` is unspecified.

`flexvector-map/index` is a variant that passes `i` as the first argument to `f` for each element.

```scheme
(flexvector-map (Î» (x) (* x 10)) (flexvector 10 20 30))
;=> #,(flexvector 100 200 300)

(flexvector-map/index (Î» (i x) (+ x (* i 2))) (flexvector 10 20 30))
;=> #,(flexvector 10 22 34)
```

#### `flexvector-map!`, `flexvector-map/index!`

`(flexvector-map! f fv1 fv2 ...)`

Similar to `flexvector-map`, but rather than mapping the new elements into a new flexvector, the new mapped elements are destructively inserted into `fv1`. Again, the dynamic order of application of `f` unspecified, so it is dangerous for `f` to apply either `flexvector-ref` or `flexvector-set!` to `fv1` in `f`.

```scheme
(let ((fv (flexvector 10 20 30)))
  (flexvector-map! (Î» (x) (* x 10)) fv)
  fv)
;=> #,(flexvector 100 200 300)

(let ((fv (flexvector 10 20 30)))
  (flexvector-map/index (Î» (i x) (+ x (* i 2))) fv)
  fv)
;=> #,(flexvector 10 22 34)
```

#### `flexvector-filter`, `flexvector-filter/index`

`(flexvector-filter pred? fv)`

Constructs a new flexvector consisting of only the elements of `fv` for which `pred?` returns a non-`#f` value. `flexvector-filter/index` passes the index of each element as the first argument to `pred?`, and the element itself as the second argument.

```scheme
(flexvector-filter even? (flexvector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8))
;=> #,(flexvector 2 4 6 8)
```

#### `flexvector-filter!`, `flexvector-filter/index!`

`(flexvector-filter! pred? fv)`

Similar to `flexvector-filter`, but destructively updates `fv` by removing all elements for which `pred?` returns `#f`. `flexvector-filter/index!` passes the index of each element as the first argument to `pred?`, and the element itself as the second argument.

```scheme
(let ((fv (flexvector 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8)))
  (flexvector-filter! odd? fv)
  fv)
;=> #,(flexvector 1 3 5 7)
```

#### `flexvector-for-each`, `flexvector-for-each/index`

`(flexvector-for-each f fv1 fv2 ...)`

Simple flexvector iterator: applies `f` to the corresponding list of parallel elements from `fv1 fv2 ...` in the range [0, `length`), where `length` is the length of the smallest flexvector argument passed, In contrast with `flexvector-map`, `f` is reliably applied in left-to-right order, starting at index 0, in the flexvectors.

`flexvector-for-each/index` is a variant that passes the index as the first argument to `f` for each element.

Example:

```scheme
(flexvector-for-each (Î» (x) (display x) (newline))
                     (flexvector "foo" "bar" "baz" "quux" "zot"))
```

Displays:

```
foo
bar
baz
quux
zot
```

#### `flexvector-count`

`(flexvector-count pred? fv1 fv2 ...)`

Counts the number of parallel elements in the flexvectors that satisfy `pred?`, which is applied, for each index `i` in the range [0, *length*) where *length* is the length of the smallest flexvector argument, to each parallel element in the flexvectors, in order.

```scheme
(flexvector-count even? (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6))
;=> 3

(flexvector-count < (flexvector 1 3 6 9) (flexvector 2 4 6 8 10 12))
;=> 2
```

#### `flexvector-cumulate`

`(flexvector-cumulate f knil fv)`

Returns a newly-allocated flexvector `new` with the same length as `fv`. Each element `i` of `new` is set to the result of `(f (flexvector-ref new (- i 1)) (flexvector-ref vec i))`, except that, for the first call on `f`, the first argument is `knil`. The `new` flexvector is returned.

```scheme
(flexvector-cumulate + 0 (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6))
;=> #,(flexvector 3 4 8 9 14 23 25 30 36)
```

### Searching

#### `flexvector-index`, `flexvector-index-right`

`(flexvector-index pred? fv1 fv2 ...)`

Finds and returns the index of the first elements in `fv1 fv2 ...` that satisfy `pred?`. If no matching element is found by the end of the shortest flexvector, `#f` is returned.

`flexvector-index-right` is similar, but returns the index of the *last* elements that satisfy `pred?`, and requires all flexvector arguments to have the same length.

```scheme
(flexvector-index even? (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5 9))
;=> 2

(flexvector-index < (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6) (flexvector 2 7 1 8 2))
;=> 1

(flexvector-index = (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5 9 2 5 6) (flexvector 2 7 1 8 2))
;=> #f

(flexvector-index-right < (flexvector 3 1 4 1 5) (flexvector 2 7 1 8 2))
;=> 3
```

#### `flexvector-skip`, `flexvector-skip-right`

`(flexvector-skip pred? fv1 fv2 ...)`

Finds and returns the index of the first elements in `fv1 fv2 ...` that do *not* satisfy `pred?`. If all the values in the flexvectors satisfy `pred?` until the end of the shortest flexvector, this returns `#f`.

`flexvector-skip-right` is similar, but returns the index of the *last* elements that do not satisfy `pred?`, and requires all flexvector arguments to have the same length.

```scheme
(flexvector-skip number? (flexvector 1 2 'a 'b 3 4 'c 'd))
;=> 2

(flexvector-skip-right number? (flexvector 1 2 'a 'b 3 4 'c 'd))
;=> 4
```

#### `flexvector-binary-search`

`(flexvector-binary-search fv value cmp [start [end]])`

Similar to `flexvector-index` and `flexvector-index-right`, but, instead of searching left-to-right or right-to-left, this performs a binary search. If there is more than one element of `fv` that matches `value` in the sense of `cmp`, `flexvector-binary-search` may return the index of any of them.

The search is performed on only the indexes of `fv` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `fv`. Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`]. It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

`cmp` should be a procedure of two arguments that returns either a negative integer, which indicates that its first argument is less than its second; zero, which indicates that they are equal; or a positive integer, which indicates that the first argument is greater than the second argument. An example `cmp` might be:

```scheme
(Î» (char1 char2)
  (cond ((char<? char1 char2) -1)
        ((char=? char1 char2) 0)
        (else 1)))
```

#### `flexvector-any`

`(flexvector-any pred? fv1 fv2 ...)`

Finds the first set of elements in parallel from `fv1 fv2 ...` for which `pred?` returns a true value. If such a parallel set of elements exists, `flexvector-any` returns the value that `pred?` returned for that set of elements. The iteration is strictly left-to-right.

#### `flexvector-every`

`(flexvector-every pred? fv1 fv2 ...)`

If, for every index `i` between 0 and the length of the shortest flexvector argument, the set of elements `(flexvector-ref fv1 i) (flexvector-ref fv2 i) ...` satisfies `pred?`, `flexvector-every` returns the value that `pred?` returned for the last set of elements, at the last index of the shortest flexvector. The iteration is strictly left-to-right.

#### `flexvector-partition`

`(flexvector-partition pred? fv)`

Returns two values: a flexvector containing all elements of `fv` that satisfy `pred?`, and a flexvector containing all elements of `fv` that do not satisfy `pred?`. Elements remain in their original order.

### Conversion

#### `flexvector->vector`

`(flexvector->vector fv [start [end]])`

Creates a vector containing the elements in `fv` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `fv`.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `vector->flexvector`

`(vector->flexvector vec [start [end]])`

Creates a flexvector containing the elements in `vec` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `vec`.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(vector-length vec)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `flexvector->list`, `reverse-flexvector->list`

`(flexvector->list fv [start [end]])`

Creates a list containing the elements in `fv` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `fv`.

`reverse-flexvector->list` is similar, but creates a list with elements in reverse order of `fv`.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `list->flexvector`, `reverse-list->flexvector`

`(list->flexvector proper-list)`

Creates a flexvector of elements from `proper-list`.

`reverse-list->flexvector` is similar, but creates a flexvector with elements in reverse order of `proper-list`.

#### `flexvector->string`

`(flexvector->string fv [start [end]])`

Creates a string containing the elements in `fv` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `fv`. It is an error if the elements are not characters.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(flexvector-length fv)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `string->flexvector`

`(string->flexvector string [start [end]])`

Creates a flexvector containing the elements in `string` between `start`, which defaults to 0, and `end`, which defaults to the length of `string`.

Both `start` and `end` are clamped to the range [0, `(string-length string)`). It is an error if `end` is less than `start`.

#### `generator->flexvector`

`(generator->flexvector gen)`

Creates a flexvector containing all elements produced by the [SRFI 158][srfi-158] generator `gen`.

## Implementation

[A sample implementation is available on GitHub.](https://github.com/ar-nelson/scheme-flexvectors) The sample implementation supports Gauche, Sagittarius, and Chibi, and includes a test suite.
